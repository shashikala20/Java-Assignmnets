If any class has any of its method abstract then you must declare entire class abstract.

• Abstract class cannot be instantiated.
  > Bacause in abstract class there is incomplete or partially completed methods .

• When we extend an abstract class, we must either override all the abstract methods in 
sub class or declare subclass as abstract.

 Abstract class cannot be private.
• Abstract class cannot be final.
   we extend abstract method to declare implementation for abstract method .
• You can declare a class abstract without having any abstract method.
